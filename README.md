####My portfolio site with links to my projects and my contact information.

####Tech Used: HMTL, CSS, JavaScript
I focused on creating a clean, modern site. In the future, I'd like to add dark mode functionality and dynamic previews of my projects when hovered over. I also need to work on optimizing my site for mobile devices.

####Lessons Learned:
A lot of what I've learned so far with this projet falls into the realm of UI. Selecting colors and imagery and ensuring the HTML of my site contained the appropraite attributes all with web accessibility in mind was a challenge.
